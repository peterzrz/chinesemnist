# chinesemnist
This project is a Kaggle-based MNIST project. I collected image datasets from Kaggle and some other Chinese websites, and cleaned them with some resizing and normalization. 
The neural network implemented here is very straight forward. The first one is a single layer dense neural network, and the second is a multi-layered CNN.
The purpose of this project is to classify and distinguish the given images which are basically Chinese chracters from zero to nine.
